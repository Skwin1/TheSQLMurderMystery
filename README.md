# TheSQLMurderMystery
## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and approach to the SQL Mystery challenge, a fun and engaging way to practice SQL skills. The challenge is hosted at [SQL Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) and requires solving a fictional crime using SQL queries.

## Solution Steps
### 1. Understanding the Scenario
   - The SQL Mystery Challenge is an interactive, problem-solving game designed to help users practice and improve their SQL querying skills. The objective of the challenge is typically to solve a fictional crime or mystery by writing SQL queries. Participants are given a database related to the mystery, which contains various tables with data that might hold clues. By formulating and executing SQL queries on this database, players can uncover information that helps them piece together the story and ultimately solve the mystery.

### 2. Analyzing the Database Schema
   - Explain how you explored the database structure (tables, columns, relationships).
   - Queries used to explore the database structure
     - ![First query given](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/013c785f-8945-41b2-8f6e-35d03a0c2d0e)
     - ![Second query given](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/cb2c48af-1b3a-4be9-9c5f-df29fd7a9ef4)

### 3. Formulating Queries
   - Discuss the process of creating SQL queries to extract relevant information.
   - You can include some of the key queries you wrote and their purposes.
   - 1st Q: What is the objective?
      - A: To find the murder that happened in SQL city

      - Notes: The murder description of the 3rd result is what we're looking for
   - 2nd Q: Using the previous data, how do I find the new data that im looking for?
      - A: Create a query to find the 2 witnesses
      - ![First_Culprit](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/67edcbf6-8cef-4bcb-a104-9bd781a6e27c)

   - 3rd Q: So now that I have the 2 witnesses' data, what do I do with this data?
      - A: See if there was a report or interview with the 2 witnesses
      - ![Witness_data](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/ec82edf0-88ee-43e0-afef-57c0fb1a9d81)
