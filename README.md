# TheSQLMurderMystery
## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and approach to the SQL Mystery challenge, a fun and engaging way to practice SQL skills. The challenge is hosted at [SQL Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) and requires solving a fictional crime using SQL queries.

## Solution Steps
### 1. Understanding the Scenario
   - The SQL Mystery Challenge is an interactive, problem-solving game designed to help users practice and improve their SQL querying skills. The objective of the challenge is typically to solve a fictional crime or mystery by writing SQL queries. Participants are given a database related to the mystery, which contains various tables with data that might hold clues. By formulating and executing SQL queries on this database, players can uncover information that helps them piece together the story and ultimately solve the mystery.

### 2. Analyzing the Database Schema
   - Explain how you explored the database structure (tables, columns, relationships).
   - Queries given:
     - ![First query given](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/ed238581-1164-405e-8ec5-ddf4e6b5809b)
     - ![Second query given](https://github.com/Skwin1/TheSQLMurderMystery/assets/107655244/35081cc4-ef71-4ff2-b3c5-04d43b0ac63a)

### 3. Formulating Queries
   - Discuss the process of creating SQL queries to extract relevant information.
   - You can include some of the key queries you wrote and their purposes.

### 4. Piecing Together the Clues
   - Describe how you interpreted the results of your queries to solve the mystery.

### 5. Solving the Mystery
   - Detail the final steps you took to solve the mystery and the conclusion you reached.
